# Robotic-Arm-Orientation
Calculates and displays the 3D orientation of a robotic arm.
The number of frames can be changed by the user, as can the the axes of rotation, magnitude of roation, and length of the robotic arm segments.
The thick colored lines represent the orientation of the world frame, the thin colored lines: the orientation of all other frames, black lines: arm segments, and the spheres mark joints.
